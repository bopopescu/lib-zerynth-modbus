.. module:: modbus

***************
MODBUS Library
***************
    To talk with a slave device an object of type ModbusTCP or ModbusSerial must be        initialized, depending on what kind of communication is needed.

    If serial communication is used, a device object that implements write, read and close methods is needed:

    Example::

        import gpio
        import streams
        import mcu
        import sfw
        from semtech.sx1503 import sx1503

        RS485EN  = D40
        LED_R    = D47
        LED_G    = D54
        LED_B    = D55
        pinmap = {                      # now add pins definition for the expander
            LED_R   : 7,                       # LED R mapped to pin 7 on sx1503
            LED_G   : 14,                      # LED G mapped to pin 14 on sx1503
            LED_B   : 15,                      # LED B mapped to pin 15 on sx1503
            RS485EN : 0,                       # RS485 pin trasmit/recieve
        }

        class RS485():
            def __init__(self, watchdog_time):
            sfw.watchdog(0, watchdog_time)
            port_expander = sx1503.SX1503(I2C0, 400000)
            gpio.add_expander(1, port_expander, pinmap)
            gpio.mode(LED_R, OUTPUT)
            gpio.mode(LED_G, OUTPUT)
            gpio.mode(LED_B, OUTPUT)
            gpio.mode(RS485EN, OUTPUT)
            gpio.low(LED_G)
            gpio.low(LED_R)
            gpio.high(LED_B)
            gpio.low(RS485EN)
            self.port = streams.serial(drvname=SERIAL1, baud=9600, set_default=False)
            
            def read(self):
                gpio.low(RS485EN)
                bc = self.port.available()
                sfw.kick()
                return self.port.read(bc)

            def write(self, packet):
                gpio.high(RS485EN)
                self.port.write(packet)
                gpio.low(RS485EN)
                sfw.kick()

            def close(self):
                self.port.close()
        
        
    When a connection with a slave device has been established, coils and registers can be accessed with the methods in each class.
